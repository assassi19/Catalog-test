good afternoon, 
i hope you read this file

i used lagranges formula to solve and i used c++ coding language and since my IDE does not support json file parsing i hardcoded the data values
rather then take json file and parse it, if i were to write the code in javascript which i am in a learning process the code would look like the javascript_iteration file where 
parsing is allowed,

thank you
