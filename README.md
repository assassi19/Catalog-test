good afternoon, 
i hope you read this file

i used lagranges formula to solve and i used c++ coding language and since i'm coding in a borrowed laptop where the IDE does not support json file parsing i hardcoded the data values
rather then take json-file as input and parse it, if i were to write the code in javascript which i am in a learning process the code would look like the javascript_iteration file where parsing is allowed

(the pre-placement talk was amazing can't wait to be part of such amazing culture & company)
thank you
